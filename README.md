# WordGenerator

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/word_generator`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'word_generator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install word_generator

## Usage


To execute on console

`irb -Ilib -rword_generator`

For static number

run `WordGenerator::Combinator.new(6686787825).generate`

To read input from console

run `WordGenerator::NumberToWord.new.combinatons`

  Benchmark.bm do |x|
    x.report {WordGenerator::Combinator.new(6686787825).generate}
  end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
